          <h4>About</h4>
          <p>The uCracker is a very simple Java program that <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">sniffs</a> the network and displays by console the IDs and passwords</strong> of all of those that try to login to some sites in that same network.<br/>
          It relies on the fact that the text that a common user puts in one of those sites, it is delivered to the network <strong>just as it's been written (it is not encoded in any way)</strong>, so I just listen to the network (sniff) and display a password when some particular format is detected.</p>
          
          <hr id="getStarted"><br/><br/>
          <h4>Get started</h4>
          <p>First of all, make sure you have installed Java 5 or heigher, then, once you have installed the application, run </p>
            <div class="container"><span class="span8 offset2"><pre>~$ java -jar uCracker.jar [-i interface] [-l loggingLevel] [--itba] [--fuckThemAll]</pre></span></div>
          <p>The <code>-i</code> parameter indicates what interface you want to sniff. <strong>We suggest you to specify one</strong>, because if not the program will search for one and there is no guarantee that interface is activated, or listening passwords.
              <br/>
            If you don't now what interface to sniff, run the <code>ipconfig</code> (on Windows) or <code>ifconfig</code> (on any UNIX platform such as Mac or Linux) command on any shell and it will list all of your interfaces. Then choose one.</p>
            <div class="container"><div class="span10 offset1 alert alert-info">
              <h5>Some tips for choosing an interface:</h5> 
              <ul>
                <li>If you are on a wireless network, such as WiFi, choose that interface that describes itself as wireless.</li>
                <li>Choose that interface that is activated. (You will get it when you run the command)</li>
              </ul>
            </div></div>

            <p>
                The sites available to sniff have to be registered by adding very simple java classes to the project and recompileing (this will be MUCH BETTER in the future, this is the first release).
            </p>

            <p>At last, but not least, the parameter <code>-l</code> indicates the logging level of the application and <strong>we suggest you not to indicate one</strong> and so the default value will be taken. The possible values for logging are
                <ul>
                  <li><code>TRACE</code> Logs a very detailed track of what is happening.</li>
                  <li><code>ERROR</code> (default) Logs when errors happened.</li>
                  <li><code>OFF</code> Don't log at all.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>If everything went well, you will see something like this</p>
            <div class="container"><div class="span8 offset2"><pre>
~$ java -jar uCracker.jar -i en1
                    ...
            </pre></div></div>
            <p>Just keep this running on any terminal of yours and come back later.</p>
          <hr id="downloads"><br/><br/>

          <h4>Downloads</h4>
          <p>Download the latest runnable jar</p>

              <tr>
                <td>runnable .jar file</td>
                <td>version</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><a href=#>uCracker.jar</a></td>
                <td>1.0</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div></div>

          <hr id="howItWorks"><br/><br/>

          <h4>How it works?</h4>
          <p>This is a very simple explication of how the uCracker works. If you want to know more about it, click below  to see the <a>detailed explication</a></p>
          <p>Imagine a very big room, where there is one person on each corner of the room, and they want to send some messages to each other but the only way to do it it's by screaming the message.
          If they want to keep confidentiality into their messages, the won't scream their message just as it is, they will encrypt it in some way, because every other person in the same room will
          listen everything they said.</p>
          <p>The same thing happens in computer networks. Each person it's a computer, and the room it's the network itself. And the analogy goes on, because <strong>a computer can listen to what other computer says</strong>, as long as they are on
          the same network, as you can see in this image.</p>

            IMAGE OF SNIFFING

          <p>So the problem here relies on <strong>how does a computer listen to another?</strong>. Here comes the concept of <a><strong>sniffing</strong></a>. To sniff is to listen to some
          determined interface on my computer(that's where the messages are being screamed) and not only to listen to the messages that come to me, but listen to them all. (Remember the
              analogy with the room, as you are on the same room you can listen to all that happens there). To set an interface to listen this way, is called listening in <a>promiscuous mode</a>.</p>

          <p>So how to sniff? There are many ways. You could use <a>wireshark</a> or <a>tcpdump</a>, the first one has got a more "user-friendly" interface and the other one does it in command line.
          Or you could do an application that uses some library for sniffing, and analyze your packets as you like, like this application does.</p>

          <p>uCracker uses a library called jpcap, which is a wrapper for Java of the library that actually sniffs, the libcap library.</p>

          <p>So we have now an application that is able to listen to every messages on the room. The only thing to do it's to add some logic to recognize those messages that has been screamed just as they are,
          this is without any encryption, parse the ids and passwords, and display it to you.</p>

            As we have mentioned before, we will have an architecture for the application like this

            So we will only interact with the jpcap api, by using a class named <code>Sniffer</code>.

          <hr id="whyDidIDoThis"><br/><br/>

		      <h4>Why did I do this?</h4>
          <p>My main goal here is to highlight two things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>CHANGE PERIODICALLY your passwords in your accounts.</li>
            <li>DON'T REPEAT your passwords between your accounts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are many leaks and bugs in the secutiry systems of many applications, such as passing passwords as plain text, and you'll have a better result if you have some conciderations each both.</p>
